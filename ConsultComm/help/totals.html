<P>

The totals plugin is a simple routine that keeps track of 
the total time you've been working. Right now you have
two settings you can modify in the Plugin Manager
(Tools->Manage Plugins):
<P>

<LI><B>Countdown To</B>: Countdown from x minutes
<LI><B>Count $</B>: Keep track of how much you've earned per hour.
Enter in the dollars per hour in this field.

To switch between totals at the bottom of ConsultComm, 
click on the totals bar to flip forward through your options,
right click to rotate backwards. Depending on the
plugins you have loaded, you should see "Earned:", "Total:",
"Billable:", "Remaining:" and "Exportable:" in the list.
