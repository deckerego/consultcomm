<P>

<A Name="JavaVersion"></A>
<DL>
<DT><B>What version of the Java Runtime Environment is needed?</B>
<DD>ConsultComm needs Java 1.4.1 or higher to run. Earlier versions
of the JRE are supported with the ConsultComm 2 series.
<P>

<A Name="WindowsInstaller"></A>
<DT><B>The Windows installer just bombs out and says "Configuration file is broken"</B>
<DD>You're probably trying to execute Setup.exe from within a .zip file, which is
confusing the installation program. The contents of the Windows installer .zip file 
need to be extracted before you can run the installation program. Probably the 
easiest way to do this is to just open up the .zip file as you normally would, then drag-n-drop the ConsultComm folder inside to your desktop. Run Setup.exe from 
the folder you just copied over and things should work fine.
<P>

<A Name="Backup"></A>
<DT><B>How do I backup/restore my personal settings?</B>
<DD>Just archive the CsltComm directory from your user directory (in Windows, this 
is a subfolder underneath <I>C:\Documents and Settings</I>). When you need them again, 
just place the contents of the folder back in your user directory.
<P>

<A Name="ProblemsStarting"></A>
<DT><B>Nothing happens when I double-click on CsltComm.jar</B>
<DD>There are a few ways to launch ConsultComm, depending on your operating
system. The Windows installer (named something akin to ConsultComm_Installer.jar 
or ConsultComm_WinInstaller.zip) will create icons in your start menu for you.
The Linux RPM installer should setup icons for most distributions of KDE or Gnome.
If you're running this from the plain ol' ConsultComm.zip file or have built
ConsultComm from source, Windows users can run the ConsultComm.bat file in the 
ConsultComm directory or Unix variants can execute the ./ConsultComm script.
<BR><BR>
If all else fails, either a) the Java Runtime Environment isn't installed 
correctly or b) your file associations are incorrect. Try uninstalling and 
reinstalling the Java Runtime Environment and see if that helps. If not, trying 
invoking ConsultComm from the command line by changing into your installation 
directory and using <CODE>java -Djava.library.path=syslibs -jar CsltComm.jar</CODE>.
<P>

<A Name="IdleProblems"></A>
<DT><B>Why can't I set ConsultComm to pause after being idle for <I>x</I>
seconds?</B>
<DT><B>Why doesn't the system tray icon appear?</B>
<DD>Currently only Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174;, Linux or other 
Unix variants running X Windows can detect how long a user session is idle 
or display the system tray icon under ConsultComm. I can support other 
platforms as well, but I would need someone to supply the source code to do 
so. If you're interested, visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/consultcomm/
<BR><BR>
If you are running ConsultComm on a supported platform but can't get 
idle time working, make sure you've download the correct installer package 
for your platform or that you've compiled the appropriate libraries when 
building from source. If everything is up to date, try going into your
ConsultComm installation directory (i.e. <I>C:\Program Files\ConsultComm</I> 
or <I>/usr/share/ConsultComm</I>) and deleting the following files from the 
<I>syslibs</I> folder:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>timeout.dll
<LI>tray.dll
<LI>libtimeout.so
<LI>libtray.so
</UL>
<BR>
Restart ConsultComm and see if that helps.

<A Name="TableNull"></A>
<DT><B>I keep getting a "Cannot find table NULL error."</B>
<DD>Note that some databases require quotes (") around the table name - so if you 
get a "Cannot find table NULL" error try placing quotes around the name.
<P>

<A Name="CreatePlugins"></A>
<DT><B>How can I create plugins?</B>
<DD>Take a look at EmptyBean in the ConsultComm source distribution. It's
an example JavaBean that demonstrates how to extend the ConsultComm plugin 
interface, react to events and register with the "Manage Plugins" window. It
should be self-documenting enough to explain how to build a plugin of your own.
If you have any questions along the way, post a message to the user forums
at http://consultcomm.sourceforge.net.

<A Name="WhyName"></A>
<DT><B>Why the heck is this called "Consultant Communicator?"</B>
<DD>That's an interesting story. Actually not so much interesting as it is 
long.
<BR><BR>
This application started out as a peer-to-peer instant messaging client. I 
thought it would be nice to have a lightweight IM app that wouldn't rely on a 
central server so I could coordinate with co-workers at our satellite office. 
I made a pretty crude version... then found myself needing a little 
application to keep track of the time I was spending on projects at work. So I 
whipped up a lil' panel to track projects as well. Turns out that people were 
much more interested in the time tracking portion of it than the IM portion of 
it. I had more requests for the project tracker and no interest whatsoever for 
the IM client. To quote the CVS entry from when I removed the instant 
messaging client code: <CODE>Just 'cause you can write a chat client doesn't 
mean you should</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
So now I've got an application that is called "Consultant Communicator" that 
doesn't do a heckuva lotta communication. But I kept the name since it was 
original, everyone already referred to it as "ConsultComm," and I don't want 
to have to think of another name. So now I just justify the name by saying "it 
allows project management and collaboration by using a standard application 
with a possible database backend." Or whatever.
