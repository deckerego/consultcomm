<FONT Size="+1">ConsultComm Frequently Asked Questions</FONT>
<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>What version of the Java Runtime Environment is needed?</B>
<DD>ConsultComm needs Java 1.4.1 or higher to run. Earlier versions
of the JRE are supported with the ConsultComm 2 series.
<P>

<DT><B>How do I backup/restore my personal settings?</B>
<DD>Just archive the CsltComm directory from your user directory. When you need 
them again, just place it back in your user directory.
<P>

<DT><B>Nothing happens when I double-click on CsltComm.jar</B>
<DD>Either a) the Java Runtime Environment isn't installed correctly or b) 
your file associations are incorrect. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the 
Java Runtime Environment and see if that helps. If not, trying invoking 
ConsultComm from the command line by using <CODE>java -jar 
CsltComm.jar</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><B>Why can't I set ConsultComm to pause after being idle for <I>x</I>
seconds?
<DD>Currently only Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174;, Solaris, Linux or other 
Unix variants running X Windows can detect how long a user session is idle 
under ConsultComm. I can support other platforms as well, but I would need 
someone to supply the source code to do so. If you're interested, visit 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/consultcomm/
<P>
<DD>If you are running ConsultComm on a supported platform but can't get 
idle time working, make sure you've download the correct installer package 
for your platform or that you've compiled the appropriate libraries when 
building from source.
<P>

<DT><B>Why the heck is this called "Consultant Communicator?"</B>
<DD>That's an interesting story. Actually not so much interesting as it is 
long.<BR>
This application started out as a peer-to-peer instant messaging client. I 
thought it would be nice to have a lightweight IM app that wouldn't rely on a 
central server so I could coordinate with co-workers at our satellite office. 
I made a pretty crude version... then found myself needing a little 
application to keep track of the time I was spending on projects at work. So I 
whipped up a lil' panel to track projects as well. Turns out that people were 
much more interested in the time tracking portion of it than the IM portion of 
it. I had more requests for the project tracker and no interest whatsoever for 
the IM client. To quote the CVS entry from when I removed the instant 
messaging client code: <CODE>Just 'cause you can write a chat client doesn't 
mean you should</CODE>.<BR>
So now I've got an application that is called "Consultant Communicator" that 
doesn't do a heckuva lotta communication. But I kept the name since it was 
original, everyone already referred to it as "ConsultComm," and I don't want 
to have to think of another name. So now I just justify the name by saying "it 
allows project management and collaboration by using a standard application 
with a possible database backend." Or whatever.
