<FONT Size="+1">System Tray Plugin</FONT>
<P>

The system tray plugin launches an icon in your operating system's
system tray panel. This allows you to reduce the clutter of your
taskbar and easily share the ConsultComm window across multiple
desktops.
<P>

The system tray plugin works in either Windows or Linux and currently
supports the following desktop environments:
<LI>WinME/NT/2000/XP/2003 
<LI>KDE 3.2 or higher
<LI>Gnome 2.6 or higher
<P>

To hide the ConsultComm window, click on the icon. To restore it,
click the icon again. Right-click the icon for additional options.
Hovering your mouse cursor over the icon will display the current
project.
<P>

The options panel for the system tray currently has no configurable 
fields.
