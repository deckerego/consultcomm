<A NAME="projects">
So you've started up ConsultComm and you're facing an empty window.
Start fillin' it up with projects. Click on Project->Add Project.
A dialog box will pop up with four fields: Group, Project, Time and
Billable.
<P>

The group is a category or client you want to group a list of projects
by. For example, "Programming" or "Goober, Goober & Dumpling." The
project field is for the project name itself, such as "Testing" or
"Meeting." Time is for the time elapsed on the project - which defaults
to zero. The billable checkbox determines if the project is billable or
not... i.e. "Lunch" would be non-billable, but "Write Code" would
be billable.
<P>

To edit a project, just double-click it. To delete it, either right-
click on the project and select "Delete," highlight and hit the
Delete key or highlight and select Project->Delete Project. To start
the timer for a project, highlight the project to watch and hit the
"Start" button. Hit "Stop" to, well, stop.

<A NAME="prefs">
There are two things that govern the behavior of ConsultComm: the 
plugins and the preferences. Let's take a look at the preferences.
<P>

To edit preferences, go to Tools->Preferences. The first tab
to open is General Properties. Here you can have time elapsed
shown in minutes or seconds. You can also specify how often
prefs and times are saved to your user directory. Animated icons
used in ConsultComm (such as the rotating bar at the bottom of
the window) can be turned on and off in the animated icons checkbox.
<P>

The next tab allows you to specify skins to change the look and
feel of ConsultComm. Skinpacks can be downloaded for SkinLF
at http://javootoo.l2fprod.com/plaf/skinlf/index.php - just specify
the skinpack at the "Use Theme Pack" field.
<P>

<A NAME="plugins">
ConsultComm supports third-party plugins used for extending
it's functionality beyond what's listed above. ConsultComm ships
with several standard plugins, such as:
<P>

<LI><A HREF="dbconnect.html">JDBC Connectivity</A>: Export your times
to any JDBC compliant database!
<LI><A HREF="timeout.html">Idle Monitor</A>: Allow ConsultComm to
pause or switch projects after a certain amount of user idle time
<LI><A HREF="totals.html">Totals Plugin</A>: Keep track of how long
you have left to work and how much you're earning by sticking
around

Plugins are installed simply by copying .jar files written for ConsultComm
