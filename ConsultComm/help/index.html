<B>About Consultant Communicator</B><BR>
Consultant Communicator (ConsultComm) is a program that allows anyone 
managing multiple projects, clients or tasks to effectively keep track of 
exactly how long they've spent on each project. 
<P>

Let's say you're a consultant. And let's say you have about five clients.
And let's say you work on three or four tasks each (answering calls,
writing code, going to meetings, working on your goofy open-source Java 
project, etc.) That's twenty tasks you have to keep track of, and of
course since you bill by the hour clients want detailed invoices. <I>They
just won't leave you alone. And they keep calling, and calling...</I>
<P>

ConsultComm to the rescue! You can easily keep track of every second
spent on projects and spent away doing other stuff. Not only that, you
can export the time kept by ConsultComm to a database so you can automate
your invoices and accounting. Plus times and preferences are stored in
XML, so you can manipulate the numbers to your twisted heart's content.
