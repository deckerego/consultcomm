                - Preferences are now saved in XML
                - Projects are now listed in a table format instead of a
                  list format
                - Fixed garbled negative time bug

                - Official site changed
        o 0.3.0
                - Added flag for billable/non-billable projects. Keep
                  track of how long you were at lunch!
                - Fixed asthetic things, ported over to Sun's Forte IDE.
        o 0.2.5
                - Fixed scrolling problem. It... just... disappeared...
        o 0.2.4
                - Images now a resource within the JAR file
                - Fixed scrolling (not two bars, both lists scroll
                  together)
        o 0.2.3
                - Batch (.bat) script is no longer released, path
                  statements are no longer part of the installation
                  process. This is left up to Sun's JRE installer.
                  The installer should both modify the path on its own
                  and allow a user to double-click on a JAR (.jar) file
                  for it to be executed.
                - Fixed bug where "Total Time" field is incorrect when
                  creating a new project while the clock is running
                - Fixed bug where time may have been deleted off of the
                  current project when creating a new one
                - Package now distributed as a JAR file
        o 0.2.2:
                - Fixed bug with total time listing - wasn't refreshing
                  as projects were deleted, edited or zeroed out
        o 0.2.1:
                - Fixed bug where new CoWorkers couldn't be entered
                  under some circumstances
        o 0.2.0:
                - Added "Total Hours" to bottom of window
                - Fixed problem with chat client where messages were
                  broken up when they ran too long
                - Added scroll bars to chat window
        o 0.1.4:
                - The "Go" and "Stop" buttons are now merged into one...
                  having two buttons was too redundant for my tastes
                - "0" is now marked as "0:00" when reading from the
                  prefs file
                - "Z" button added to zero-out projects (show no elapsed
                  time)
                - Extremely pesky chat bug fixed... chat requests are
                  quicker and work every time now
        o 0.1.3:
                - Project tracker was updating & backing up every second,
                  changed to every minute
                - Code optimized
        o 0.1.2:
                - Error message now pops up when trying to send a message
                  to someone not online
                - Fixed bug where CoWorker List would only allow one entry
        o 0.1.1:
                - Fixed problem with editing a running project and having
                  the time changes be ignored
                - Added animated icon at bottom to show that clock is
                  running
                - Prefs are backed up every minute now (to safeguard
                  against crashes, will be a preference itself soon).
