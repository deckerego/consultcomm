To install Consultant Communicator:

If you have the binary package (the file CsltComm.zip) -
 1) Make sure that you have Sun's Java JRE 1.3 or higher installed.
    To see if the JRE has been installed or not, simply type:
      > java -version
    at the command line. If a "program not found" error occurs, install the
    Java Runtime Environment, available from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/
2) If you are NOT using Java 2 1.4 or higher you must download the 
    Java API for XML processing. Visit http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html
    to download the package, then place the included JAR files (jaxp.jar,
    xalan.jar and crimson.jar) into your Java Extensions directory 
    (/usr/java/jre/lib/ext in Linux, C:\java\jre\lib\ext in Windows).
 3) Unzip the contents of CsltComm.zip into a new folder (if you don't
    have a utility to unzip files, check out http://www.winzip.com)
 4) Double-click on the file CsltComm.jar that you just extracted

If you want to build a version from the source pacakge (CsltComm.src.tar.gz) -
 1) Make sure you have Sun's Java SDK 1.3 or higher installed
    (go to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/ if you need a copy)
 2) If you are NOT using Java 2 1.4 or higher you must download the 
    Java API for XML processing. Visit http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html
    to download the package, then place the included JAR files (jaxp.jar,
    xalan.jar and crimson.jar) into your Java Extensions directory 
    (/usr/java/jre/lib/ext in Linux, C:\java\jre\lib\ext in Windows).
 3) Unzip the contents of CsltComm.src.tar.gz into a new folder
 4) Change into the folder you extracted the files to
 5) Run the command 'make' followed by 'make package'
 6) Double-click on the file CsltComm.jar that should have been build by
    step 3

JDBC Connections:

If you want to use JDBC connectivity, you'll need to have a .jar or .zip file 
that contains your JDBC database driver. I can't provide that... but Sun 
offers a list at http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers . You can 
also use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver that Sun releases with the Java SDK - 
details concerning the Sun bridge driver are available at 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/bridge.doc.html .

Once you have the coorect JAR or ZIP files, place them in the Java Runtime 
Environment's extensions directory (/usr/java/jre/lib/ext in Linux, 
C:\java\jre\lib\ext in Windows). If the driver files are in the correct ext/
directory, ConsultComm should be able to notice them automatically.
