<LI><B>JDBC Connections</B>
<P>
<DD>If you want to use JDBC connectivity, you'll need to have a .jar or .zip 
file that contains your JDBC database driver. I can't provide that... but Sun 
offers a list at <A 
HREF="http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers">http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers</A>  
. You can also use the JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver that Sun releases with the 
Java SDK - details concerning the Sun bridge driver are available at <A 
HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/bridge.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/jdbc/getstart/bridge.doc.html</A>.<BR>
<DD>Once you have the correct JAR or ZIP files, place them in the Java 
Runtime Environment's extensions directory (see <A HREF="$APPPATHS">Important 
Directories You Might Need to Know</A> for the location of your 
extensions directory). If the driver files are in the correct ext/
directory, ConsultComm should be able to notice them automatically.<BR>
