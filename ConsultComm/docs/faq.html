<P>

<DL>
<DT><B>How do I backup/restore my personal settings?</B>
<DD>Just archive both ClntComm.def and JDBCConnection.def somewhere. When you 
need them again, just place 'em in the same directory that ConsultComm runs 
in.
<P>

<DT><B>Nothing happens when I double-click on CsltComm.jar</B>
<DD>Either a) the Java Runtime Environment isn't installed correctly or b) 
your file associations are incorrect. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the 
Java Runtime Environment and see if that helps. If not, trying invoking 
ConsultComm from the command line by using <CODE>java -jar 
CsltComm.jar</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><B>Can ConsultComm switch projects or automatically pause if I'm away 
from my computer for <I>x</I> minutes?
<DD>Not really. Currently there's no good way (that I know of) to have a Java 
application monitor for system inactivity. It would be nice to have 
ConsultComm automatically pause or switch to a "Lunch" project after ten 
minutes of inactivity or so... but right now it doesn't seem possible.
<P>

<DT><B>I try to start up ConsultComm, but it keeps saying "Java API for XML 
Processing was not found."</B>
<DD>You might get this if you are using the Java Runtime Environment earlier 
than 1.4 or if you haven't installed the Java XML libraries correctly. 
Download the Java XML API at 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html</A>
 and install all of the .jar files that come with it into the Java Extensions 
directory on your computer (/usr/java/jre/lib/ext in Linux, 
C:\java\jre\lib\ext in Windows). If the JAR files aren't in the correct 
extensions directory, ConsultComm can't load.
