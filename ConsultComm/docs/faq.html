<DT><B>How do I backup/restore my personal settings?</B>
<DD>Just archive the CsltComm directory from your user directory. When you need 
them again, just place it back in your user directory.
See <A HREF="$APPPATHS">Important Directories You Might Need to Know</A> 
to find out what your user directory is.
<P>

<DT><B>Nothing happens when I double-click on CsltComm.jar</B>
<DD>Either a) the Java Runtime Environment isn't installed correctly or b) 
your file associations are incorrect. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the 
Java Runtime Environment and see if that helps. If not, trying invoking 
ConsultComm from the command line by using <CODE>java -jar 
CsltComm.jar</CODE>.
<P>

<DT><B>Can ConsultComm switch projects or automatically pause if I'm away 
from my computer for <I>x</I> minutes?
<DD>Not really. Currently there's no good way (that I know of) to have a Java 
application monitor for system inactivity. It would be nice to have 
ConsultComm automatically pause or switch to a "Lunch" project after ten 
minutes of inactivity or so... but right now it doesn't seem possible.
<P>

<DT><B>I try to start up ConsultComm, but it keeps saying "Java API for XML 
Processing was not found."</B>
<DD>You might get this if you are using the Java Runtime Environment earlier 
than 1.4 or if you haven't installed the Java XML libraries correctly. 
Download the Java XML API at 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html">http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html</A>
 and install all of the .jar files that come with it into the Java Extensions 
directory on your computer (see <A HREF="$APPPATHS">Important Directories You 
Might Need to Know</A> for the location of your extensions directory). If the 
JAR files aren't in the correct extensions directory, ConsultComm can't load.
<P>

<DT><B>Why the heck is this called "Consultant Communicator?"</B>
<DD>That's an interesting story. Actually not so much interesting as it is 
long.<BR>
This application started out as a peer-to-peer instant messaging client. I 
thought it would be nice to have a lightweight IM app that wouldn't rely on a 
central server so I could coordinate with co-workers at our satellite office. 
I made a pretty crude version... then found myself needing a little 
application to keep track of the time I was spending on projects at work. So I 
whipped up a lil' panel to track projects as well. Turns out that people were 
much more interested in the time tracking portion of it than the IM portion of 
it. I had more requests for the project tracker and no interest whatsoever for 
the IM client. To quote the CVS entry from when I removed the instant 
messaging client code: <CODE>Just 'cause you can write a chat client doesn't 
mean you should</CODE>.<BR>
So now I've got an application that is called "Consultant Communicator" that 
doesn't do a heckuva lotta communication. But I kept the name since it was 
original, everyone already referred to it as "ConsultComm," and I don't want 
to have to think of another name. So now I just justify the name by saying "it 
allows project management and collaboration by using a standard application 
with a possible database backend." Or whatever.
